Created a parse tree for structured data extraction.
Flexibility with multiple parser options (lxml, html5lib).
Ideal for smaller projects, prioritizing rapid development.
Requests:

Facilitated sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
Separated networking concerns from HTML parsing.
Enhanced code organization and maintainability.
Enabled efficient division of labor between networking and parsing.
Comparison with Other Libraries:

Chose BeautifulSoup and Requests over complex options like Scrapy.
Simplicity of implementation and ease of debugging.
Clear separation of concerns for improved code structure.
Rapid development suited for smaller-scale projects.
